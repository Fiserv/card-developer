**<span style="color:#ff6600;">Payment Hold:</span>** feature displays payment float information. 
Unlike posted payments, floating payments affect the cardholder’s available credit. In both cases, the payment decreases the account’s outstanding balance and reduces the amount due or past due.

* Posting a payment increases the available credit.
* Floating a payment does not increase the cardholder’s available credit until after the float days have passed.

The float days is the amount of time between when an individual submits a payment and when the individual's bank moves funds from the account.
